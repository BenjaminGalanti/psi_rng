Arduino and processing code for a DIY Hardware Random Number Generator.

#Hardware

I work on a reproduction of an Hardware Random Number Generator made by Rob Seward http://robseward.com/misc/RNG2/
inspire by the work of Aaron Logue (http://www.cryogenius.com/hardware/rng/). I want to thank both of you for sharing your work.

My goal is to study effect of the human mind (and maybe also animals) on the matter throw the influence of hardware based randomness generation.

I will try to reproduice the principles of Rene Poec'h experiment with baby chicken and a robot but with a "software robot" guide with the RNG.

I will also create new kinds of experiments, more on this later...
