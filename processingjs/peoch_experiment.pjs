/**
 * This is attempt to reproduice the experiment that Ren√© Peoc'h did in 1986 for his medicine
 * thesis with a little robot called Tychoscope. The difference here is that we reproduice the
 * robot behaviour in software. Therefor, the subject has to concentrate on his computer screen 
 * instead of a real robot. Dimensions are not the same, since the screen size can't be
 * as big as the paper board used by Peoc'h, but the ratio is kept.
 * 
 * Quick description : a robot moving randomly (using an electronic noise to generate it's random numbers)
 * is land on a big paper board (88x59cm) with "walls"
 * so it can't go outside. It's diameter is 8cm.
 * It's choosing randomly it's orientation (clockwise or not), it's direction (forward or backward),
 * the distance it travel each move and the angle of rotation.
 * The trail of the robot is drawn by a pencil place at it's center.
 * If we let the robot alone, the trails are statistically random, this mean the robot goes in every
 * direction (the paper is divided in 4 area for the statistics) with no preference of one over another.
 * If someone (or even a conditioned chick) sit himself in front of the robot and "mentaly" want 
 * it to come closer. Statistically, the robot will go more often to the direction of the person.
 * In the case of conditioned chick, the robot goes, on average, 2.5 times more in the direction of the 
 * chick.
 * 
 * In this "reproduction", we want to know if the effect will be the same with a robot on a screen and
 * the random number generator not close to the subject. Similar experiment already demonstrate that the
 * distance to the generator does not affect the results, even if it's a very long distance (hundreds of km).
