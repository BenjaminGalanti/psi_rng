WISH LIST :
- Anim smoothly the bezier curve by displaying only part of the last curve instead of display it "brutally" when it's done.
We wan't to fill that the curve is drawing in real time :)
- Be able to pass options (draw curve, hide robot, speed, duration etc.) to the experiment instead of using constants
- Use PVector instead of int array in processingJs to store points...
- fix the collision bug with the robot and the frame
- Remove the canva's margin in chromium
- Add a proper log system ? => Maybe log should be done only via client and then save to the server hosting experiments?
- Modify index.html to load either the robot_hazard experiment or random_graph
DONE:
- draw bezier curves (made of 4 points) instead of lines for the robot trajectory.
- Build the electronic device
- make it work on the raspberry pi
- Test cross domain websocket
- use mkfifo instead of mknode
- modify client/server code to work properly with FIFO
- add message like "Wait for client to connect"
- Modify code to work with binary data and test if it work in JS
